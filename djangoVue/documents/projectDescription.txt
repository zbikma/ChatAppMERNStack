Project Overview
For this project, you’ll create a small blogging application with some rudimentary features:

Authors can write many posts.
Posts can have many tags and can be either published or unpublished.
You’ll build the back end of this blog in Django, complete with an admin for adding new blog content. Then you’ll expose the content data as a GraphQL API and use Vue to display that data in the browser.

You’ll accomplish this in several high-level steps. At the end of each step, you’ll find a link to the source code for that stage of the project.
